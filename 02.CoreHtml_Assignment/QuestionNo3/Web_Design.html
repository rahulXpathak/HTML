    <h1>Web Design</h1>
    <p>
        Web design focuses on the aesthetic and user experience aspects of a website. 
        Good design is not only visually appealing but also easy to navigate and use. 
        It combines elements like layout, color schemes, typography, and responsiveness to create a pleasant user experience.
