5. Compare and contrast a text editor and an IDE, highlighting their key features and uses.
Ans:
    Text Editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are both essential tools for coding, but they serve different purposes and offer distinct features. Here's a comparison:

    Text Editor
        Definition: A lightweight tool primarily used for writing and editing plain text files, including code.
        Key Features:
        Simplicity: Minimalistic interface focused on text editing.
        Flexibility: Supports a wide range of programming languages with syntax highlighting.
        Customization: Often highly customizable with plugins and extensions (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
        Speed: Generally faster to load and use due to the lack of heavy features.
        Use Case: Ideal for quick edits, scripting, and situations where a full IDE is not required.
        IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
        Definition: A comprehensive software suite that provides tools and features for software development, beyond just code editing.

    Key Features:
        Code Editor: Includes all the features of a text editor, such as syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
        Debugger: Integrated tools for testing and debugging code within the same environment.
        Compiler/Interpreter: Built-in tools to compile or run the code, often specific to the programming language.
        Project Management: Advanced project navigation, version control integration (e.g., Git), and dependency management.
        Code Refactoring: Tools for reorganizing code structure without changing its external behavior.
        Integrated Terminal: Access to command-line tools directly within the IDE.
        Use Case: Suitable for larger projects, complex applications, and development environments where integration of multiple tools is beneficial (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, Eclipse).
        Comparison Summary
        Ease of Use: Text editors are simpler and quicker to start with, making them ideal for basic tasks. IDEs are more feature-rich, providing an all-in-one solution for complex development needs.
        Resource Usage: Text editors are lighter and use fewer system resources, while IDEs can be resource-intensive due to their comprehensive toolsets.
        Functionality: Text editors focus on editing and can be extended with plugins, whereas IDEs offer a complete development environment with debugging, building, and version control.
        Customization: Text editors tend to be more customizable, allowing users to tailor the environment precisely to their needs, while IDEs provide more built-in functionality out of the box.
