1: Explain the main components of client-server architecture and their functions.
ans:-
    Client-Server Architecture is a network design model where tasks are divided between 
    providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. 
    Here are the main components:

    i.Client:
        Function: Requests services or resources from the server.
        Examples: Web browsers, mobile apps, desktop applications.
        Role: Initiates communication with the server, sending requests and 
        waiting for responses.

    ii.Server:
        Function: Provides services or resources requested by clients.
        Examples: Web servers, database servers, file servers.
        Role: Listens for incoming client requests, processes them, and 
        sends back the appropriate response.
        
    iii.Networks:
        Function: The medium through which clients and servers communicate.
        Examples: The internet, local area networks (LANs).
        Role: Facilitates data transfer between the client and server.
    
    iv.Protocols:
        Function: Define rules for communication between client and server.
        Examples: HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, TCP/IP.
        Role: Ensure data is transmitted and received in an orderly and reliable 
        manner.

In summary, the client-server architecture is built on the interaction between clients 
(which request services), servers (which provide services), and the network (which connects them), 
all governed by specific communication protocols.
