4.What are the advantages of using a Version Control System like Git in a development project?
Ans:
    Using a Version Control System (VCS) like Git in a development project offers several key advantages:

     Collaboration:
        Benefit: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
        Use: Teams can manage code changes in parallel, merging updates from different team members efficiently.

    History Tracking:
        Benefit: Git records every change made to the codebase over time.
        Use: Developers can track who made changes, what changes were made, and when, enabling easier debugging and understanding of the code's evolution.

    Branching and Merging:
        Benefit: Developers can create branches to work on new features or fixes independently of the main codebase.
        Use: Allows experimentation and development without affecting the stable version of the project. Once ready, branches can be merged back into the main codebase.

    Reversion and Recovery:
        Benefit: Git enables reverting to previous versions of the code if something goes wrong.
        Use: Protects against accidental errors or bugs by allowing developers to roll back to a stable state.

    Backup and Redundancy:
        Benefit: The entire project history is stored in the Git repository, which can be cloned or backed up.
        Use: Provides a safeguard against data loss and makes it easy to restore the project in case of failure.

    Code Review and Quality Assurance:
        Benefit: Git supports pull requests and code reviews before changes are merged into the main branch.
        Use: Ensures code quality and facilitates collaborative review, leading to more robust and error-free software.

    Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
        Benefit: Git integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
        Use: Enhances efficiency by automatically building and testing code whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
