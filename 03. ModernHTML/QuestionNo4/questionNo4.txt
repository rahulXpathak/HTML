4. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML

Ans:
    
    Improving the accessibility of HTML involves implementing various techniques to ensure that all users, 
    including those with disabilities, can effectively interact with web content. Here are three ways to 
    enhance HTML accessibility:

    1.Use Semantic HTML Elements:
        Semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, and others provide 
        meaning to the structure of the content. This helps assistive technologies, like screen readers, 
        understand the context and navigate the page more easily.

        For example, using <button> instead of a <div> styled as a button conveys that the element is interactive, 
        which is important for accessibility tools.

    2.Provide Alternative Text for Images:
        Adding descriptive alt attributes to <img> tags ensures that users who cannot see the images can understand 
        the content through screen readers or if the images fail to load.

        The alt text should be concise yet descriptive, explaining the purpose of the image in the context of the content.

    3.Ensure Keyboard Accessibility:
        All interactive elements (like links, buttons, form fields) should be usable with keyboard navigation. This means using 
        standard HTML controls that inherently support keyboard events (e.g., <button>, <a>, <input>).
        
        Implement a logical tab order (tabindex) and use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles, states, and properties 
        when necessary to improve navigation for users relying on keyboards or assistive technologies.
